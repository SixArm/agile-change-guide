# Agile-adjacent ceremonies

Agile-adjacent ceremonies are structured meetings, particularly in Scrum frameworks. These time-boxed events create rhythm and predictability while fostering collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement throughout the development process.

Sprint planning initiates each iteration. The development team collaborates with the product owner to select and commit to work items from the product backlog.

Daily standups, typically held each morning, provide brief synchronization points where team members share progress updates, identify obstacles, and coordinate upcoming work. These short meetings maintain momentum and enable quick problem-solving.

Showcases occur at the end of each iteration, allowing teams to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.

Retrospectives follow reviews, focusing internally on team processes and dynamics. Participants reflect on what worked well, identify areas for improvement, and commit to actionable changes.

Additional ceremonies may include backlog refinement sessions, where teams collaboratively review and prepare upcoming work items, ensuring they are well-defined and ready for future sprints.
